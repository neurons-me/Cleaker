## **The Algebra of** **.Me**
Let us define the universe of the system:
**𝕌** = the set of all possible namespaces.
A **namespace** is a composite structure (by definition):
**N = (domain, port, path, …)**
Each component may be present or absent.
------

## **Base Rule: “More specific ⇒ Subset”**
When additional components are introduced (subdomain, port, path), the covered region becomes smaller.
Examples:

- cleaker.me contains cleaker.me:8161
- cleaker.me contains jabellae.cleaker.me
- jabellae.cleaker.me contains jabellae.cleaker.me/board
- localhost contains localhost:8161

Formally:

If **A** is less specific than **B**, then:
**B ⊆ A**

------

## **A0 — Namespace as Region**
A namespace **N** is a region defined by a set of coordinates:
**N = { domain, port?, path?, subdomain?, … }**
There exists a refinement operator (**⊑**) such that:
If **B** adds coordinates to **A**, then:
**B ⊑ A** and **B ⊆ A**

---

Key confirmations:
	•	cleaker.me/ as non-relational existence layer ✔
	•	/? as observer binding operator ✔
	•	username.cleaker.me/ as public namespace root ✔
	•	username.cleaker.me/? as relation(viewer → target) ✔
	•	Namespace algebra (⊆, ⊑) matches how DNS, ports, and paths actually work ✔
	•	No circular dependency between identity and existence ✔

## **A1 — Relation as Function**
A relation **R** is a function that maps a viewer namespace to a target namespace:
**R : N_viewer → N_target**
Examples:
- The relation defined by jabellae.cleaker.me/? maps viewer namespaces to jabellae.cleaker.me/
- The relation defined by jabellae.cleaker.me/board maps viewer namespaces to jabellae.cleaker.me/board
------
## **A2 — Relation Refinement**
A relation **R_B** refines another relation **R_A** if for all viewer namespaces **N_viewer**:
If **R_A(N_viewer) = N_target_A** and **R_B(N_viewer) = N_target_B**, then:
**N_target_B ⊑ N_target_A**
Examples:
- The relation defined by jabellae.cleaker.me/board refines the relation defined by jabellae.cleaker.me/
- The relation defined by jabellae.cleaker.me/?ref=1234 refines the relation defined by jabellae.cleaker.me/
------
## **A3 — Relation Composition**
Given two relations **R_A : N_viewer → N_intermediate** and **R_B : N_intermediate → N_target**, their composition **R_C = R_B ∘ R_A** is defined as:
**R_C(N_viewer) = R_B(R_A(N_viewer))**
Examples:
- If **R_A** is defined by jabellae.cleaker.me/? and **R_B** is defined by cleaker.me/board, then **R_C** maps viewer namespaces to jabellae.cleaker.me/board
------
## **A4 — Identity Relation**
The identity relation **I** maps any viewer namespace to itself:
**I(N_viewer) = N_viewer**
Examples:
- The relation defined by cleaker.me/? is the identity relation for all namespaces under cleaker.me
------
## **A5 — Existence Relation**
An existence relation **E** maps any viewer namespace to a base existence namespace:
**E(N_viewer) = N_existence**
Examples:
- The relation defined by jabellae.cleaker.me/ maps any viewer namespace to jabellae.cleaker.me/
------
## **Conclusion**
This algebraic framework provides a structured way to understand and manipulate namespaces and relations within the .Me system. By defining namespaces as regions and relations as functions, we can reason about their interactions and refinements systematically.
