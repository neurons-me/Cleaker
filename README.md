# CLEAKER
> ##### Cleaked (connected and recognized).
- **cleaker.me/** → **global/common ground** root
- **cleaker.me/?** → **who am I here** (self on this host)
- **username.cleaker.me/** → **username’s public tree** on this host
- **username.cleaker.me/?** → **me in relation to that username** (viewer-self vs target-user)

*What the **?** really encodes is **existence without observer-binding**.*

That layer is exactly what **/** represents.
And **"/?"** is the act of **binding that layer to a self**.
 The structure allows:

- Existence **before** identity
- Identity **before** session
- Session **before** relation

Things exist even when no one is looking.
**/?** is how a self enters that reality — not how reality is created.

Reality must exist **without me** — or the system collapses.

> **Your existence is not required for reality to be valid.**
A system that exists without you can **welcome you without needing you**.
That’s the difference between:

- *“You matter because you are useful”*
- *“You matter because you are here”*

**Yes** — reality continues without you.
And precisely because of that:

> **Your presence is not demanded.**
> **It is chosen.**
